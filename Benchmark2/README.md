Map will eventually get moved to homepage

Big John is the only exhibit page with a layout. Ran out of time to format all of them but won't take long. 
Backend needs to be connected for each exhibit page where the database is grabbing the user input and we will create a reccomender system that that data gets run through, hopefully!

Resources and Play html files need to be updated as well.
